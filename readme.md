# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game project! This is a simple game implemented in Rust where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number.

This project is simply an educational project for me to introduce myself to rust programming language and doesn't have any value independently.

Have fun!

## Installation

To run the Guessing Game, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/apri-me/guessing-game.git
cd guessing-game
```

## Usage

To play the Guessing Game, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
cargo run
```

The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and you will be prompted to enter your guess. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number!
